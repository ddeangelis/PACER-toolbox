1. Data filtering - checkboxes for all potential filter criteria, then dynamic UI. Example: Filter based on market cap with 2 sliders for min/max. 
2. Print the filtered table
3. improve graphics & histogram. Do auto-bin count.
4. Interactive ancova/anova and linear models (lm) with R^2 readout
	# Simple Linear regression
	lm(CPU_results[2,-1] ~ CPU_results[1,-1])
	lm(as.numeric(CPU_results[2,-1]) ~ as.numeric(CPU_results[1,-1]))

	# Helpful functions
	coefficients()
	summary()

5. Have tab that shows contents from DESCRIPTION and Readme.md
6. Make better Data Prep and Analysis panel labels.
7. Empty results in the search yield errors. need to fix this.
8. Is it necessary to duplicate code for plaintiff vs. defendant? Can't we just set a value based on active tab?
